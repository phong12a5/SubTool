            field: id: The ID of the file.
            field: kind: This is always drive#file.
            field: name: The name of the file. This is not necessarily unique
                within a folder.
            field: mime_type: The MIME type of the file. Drive will attempt to
                automatically detect an appropriate value from uploaded content
                if no value is provided. The value cannot be changed unless a
                new revision is uploaded.
            field: description: A short description of the file.
            field: starred: Whether the user has starred the file.
            field: trashed: Whether the file has been trashed, either explicitly
                or from a trashed parent folder. Only the owner may trash a
                file, and other users cannot see files in the owner's trash.
            field: explicitly_trashed: Whether the file has been explicitly
                trashed, as opposed to recursively trashed from a parent folder.
            field: parents: The IDs of the parent folders which contain the
                file. If not specified as part of a create request, the file
                will be placed directly in the My Drive folder. Update requests
                must use the addParents and removeParents parameters to modify
                the values.
            field: spaces: The list of spaces which contain the file. The
                currently supported values are 'drive', 'appDataFolder' and
                'photos'.
            field: version: A monotonically increasing version number for the
                file. This reflects every change made to the file on the server,
                even those not visible to the user.
            field: web_content_link: A link for downloading the content of the
                file in a browser. This is only available for files with binary
                content in Drive.
            field: web_view_link: A link for opening the file in a relevant
                Google editor or viewer in a browser.
            field: icon_link: A static, unauthenticated link to the file's icon.
            field: thumbnail_link: A short-lived link to the file's thumbnail,
                if available. Typically lasts on the order of hours.
            field: viewed_by_me: Whether the file has been viewed by this user.
            field: viewed_by_me_time: The last time the file was viewed by the
                user (RFC 3339 date-time).
            field: created_time: The time at which the file was created (RFC
                3339 date-time).
            field: modified_time: The last time the file was modified by anyone
                (RFC 3339 date-time). Note that setting modifiedTime will also
                update modifiedByMeTime for the user.
            field: modified_by_me_time: The last time the file was modified by
                the user (RFC 3339 date-time).
            field: shared_with_me_time: The time at which the file was shared
                with the user, if applicable (RFC 3339 date-time).
            field: sharing_user: The user who shared the file with the
                requesting user, if applicable.
            field: owners: The owners of the file. Currently, only certain
                legacy files may have more than one owner.
            field: last_modifying_user: The last user to modify the file.
            field: shared: Whether the file has been shared.
            field: owned_by_me: Whether the user owns the file.
            field: viewers_can_copy_content: Whether users with only reader or
                commenter permission can copy the file's content. This affects
                copy, download, and print operations.
            field: permissions: The full list of permissions for the file. This
                is only available if the requesting user can share the file.
            field: folder_color_rgb: The color for a folder as an RGB hex
                string. The supported colors are published in the
                folderColorPalette field of the About resource. If an
                unsupported color is specified, the closest color in the palette
                will be used instead.
            field: original_filename: The original filename of the uploaded
                content if available, or else the original value of the name
                field. This is only available for files with binary content in
                Drive.
            field: full_file_extension: The full file extension extracted from
                the name field. May contain multiple concatenated extensions,
                such as 'tar.gz'. This is only available for files with binary
                content in Drive. This is automatically updated when the name
                field changes, however it is not cleared if the new name does
                not contain a valid extension.
            field: file_extension: The final component of fullFileExtension.
                This is only available for files with binary content in Drive.
            field: md5_checksum: The MD5 checksum for the content of the file.
                This is only applicable to files with binary content in Drive.
            field: size: The size of the file's content in bytes. This is only
                applicable to files with binary content in Drive.
            field: quota_bytes_used: The number of storage quota bytes used by
                the file. This includes the head revision as well as previous
                revisions with keepForever enabled.
            field: head_revision_id: The ID of the file's head revision. This is
                currently only available for files with binary content in Drive.
            field: content_hints: Additional information about the content of
                the file. These fields are never populated in responses.
            field: image_media_metadata: Additional metadata about image media,
                if available.
            field: video_media_metadata: Additional metadata about video media.
                This may not be available immediately upon upload.
            field: is_app_authorized: Whether the file was created or opened by
                the requesting app.
